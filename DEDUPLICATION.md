# Deduplication

I didn't add any linting or much to this solution. I tried not to document too much and instead make the code self-explanatory, but documentation still exists to help a developer who is new to this code.

I chose this particular method because it naturally evolves while demonstrating recursion and does not rely on any special 'magic' functions that could accomplish this task as well but not demonstate how recusion works.
